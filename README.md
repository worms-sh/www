# `www.worms.sh`

This is the source code repository for `www.worms.sh`. The site is under active
construction!

Tilde pages are not kept here since they are pulled from separate user
directories.

TODO:

- add pages:
  - ideas + projects
    - make page open contribution (future: make it into a moodboard, forum,
      interactive, asynchronous thing)
    - some starter ideas: chatrooms (local, online); worms.sh colors
