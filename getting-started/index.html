          <h2 id="mac">Mac</h2>

          <p>
            Since MacOS is a UNIX-like OS, getting set up is relatively
            straightforward.
          </p>

          <p>
            You‚Äôll need access to the <code>Terminal</code> application. You can
            find it by searching for it in Spotlight (Cmd-Space) or looking in
            your Applications folder. It may be in a ‚ÄòUtilities‚Äô sub-folder.
          </p>

          <h3 id="command-line-shell-basics">Command line shell basics</h3>

          <p>
            Before getting into how to access <code>worms.sh</code>, I‚Äôll go
            over some command line basics. If you want a more thorough
            introduction,
            <a
              href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview"
            >
              this one from Ubuntu Linux
            </a>
            is pretty good. A couple details won‚Äôt apply on your Mac (or on
            <code>worms.sh</code>), but the basics are the same.
          </p>

          <p>Open up your Terminal app. You should see something like:</p>

          <p><code class="codeblock">baba@macbook ~ %</code></p>

          <p>
            This is an interactive command line shell! The primary purpose of a
            UNIX shell is to take program names as input and run those commands.
            For example, try typing <code>ls</code> and press Enter. You should
            see a list of familiar names appear on the screen. You just ran the
            <code>ls</code> program, which lists the files and directories in
            your current directory!<a
              href="#fn2"
              class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref2"
              role="doc-noteref"
              ><sup>2</sup></a
            >
            To find out what your current directory is, try running the
            <code>pwd</code> program:
          </p>

          <p>
            <code class="codeblock"
              >baba@macbook ~ % pwd<br />
              /Users/baba</code
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>pwd</code> is short for ‚ÄúParent Working Directory‚Äù, and the
            program prints the directory you are currently in. You should see
            that you‚Äôre currently in your user‚Äôs home directory, explaining why
            <code>ls</code> showed you the files in your home directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>cd</code> is another useful program which stands for ‚ÄúChange
            Directory.‚Äù Try running <code>cd Documents</code> and then running
            the <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code> commands. You can navigate
            to virtually any directory on your computer with <code>cd</code> and
            check out its contents with <code>ls</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The UNIX shell can run all sorts of programs, including file
            management programs, text editors, data processing programs, and
            more. Anything that a computer can do that doesn‚Äôt inherently depend
            on graphics can be done through the command line interface!
          </p>

          <p>
            The UNIX shell is a powerful tool and will be the primary way that
            you interact with <code>worms.sh</code>. While there‚Äôs a
            <em>lot</em> more to the UNIX shell and many programs to learn
            about, we‚Äôll stop here and get you set up on <code>worms.sh</code>.
            Once you‚Äôre logged onto <code>worms.sh</code>, you can explore
            freely without worrying about messing up any important files on your
            computer!
          </p>

          <h3 id="setting-up-your-credentials">Setting up your credentials</h3>

          <p>
            You‚Äôll use
            <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?ssh"
              ><code>ssh</code></a
            >
            to access your interactive shell on <code>worms.sh</code>. SSH is
            the most widely used protocol for securely accessing remote shells
            and is already installed on your Mac! To authenticate with
            <code>worms.sh</code>, you need to create an SSH
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"
              >key pair</a
            >. You can read up on the technical details if you‚Äôre interested,
            but you don‚Äôt need to know the details to set it up. The basic idea
            is that you‚Äôll generate a random key which will allow you to
            authenticate with the <code>worms.sh</code> server. This key will
            live on your computer, meaning you can only log in to your account
            using the computer you generate the key with! If you have multiple
            computers, you can repeat the process with each to add a key from
            each computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            To generate an SSH key, follow these steps (if at any point you make
            a mistake, you can type <code>Ctrl-C</code> to terminate the
            command):
          </p>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>Open a new Terminal window.</li>
            <li>
              Run the following command: <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be guided through an interactive process. For the first
              prompt, press <code>Enter</code> to accept the default key file.<a
                href="#fn3"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"
                ><sup>3</sup></a
              >
              It should be something like
              <code>/Users/&lt;username&gt;/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the next prompt, enter a passphrase for the key. Please choose
              a secure passphrase! While you‚Äôre allowed to make a key without a
              passphrase, this lowers the security considerably. Note that when
              you type, you won‚Äôt see any characters appear on screen. Don‚Äôt
              worry, your inputs are still registering!
            </li>
            <li>You‚Äôll be asked to confirm the passphrase</li>
            <li>
              If successful, you‚Äôll see a message telling you where your
              identifications and public key are saved, along with a ‚Äúkey
              fingerprint‚Äù and a randomart image. You now have an SSH key!
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            In actuality, your SSH key is two keys. It consists of a
            <em>private key</em> (<code>id_ed25519</code>) and a
            <em>public key</em> (<code>id_ed25519.pub</code>). As the names
            suggest, your private key is secret and your public key is public!<a
              href="#fn4"
              class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref4"
              role="doc-noteref"
              ><sup>4</sup></a
            >
            You can share your public key as widely as you please. In fact,
            you‚Äôll need to share it with me, the administrator, in order for me
            to grant you access to <code>worms.sh</code>. However, you should
            take great care to keep your private key secret!
          </p>

          <p>
            To view your public key, type the following command:
            <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>. Here‚Äôs my public key as an
            example:
          </p>

          <p>
            <code class="codeblock"
              >baba@macbook ~ % cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub<br />
              ssh-ed25519
              AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGV6m2CcaZXez2AesDqBETIJJzigsE4Vtv/StBo+q/oe
              baba@macbook</code
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you generate your public key, you‚Äôll need to send it to the
            admin along with your username! Once this is done, you can continue
            below to <a href="#connect">Connecting to <code>worms.sh</code></a
            >.
          </p>

          <h2 id="connecting-to-worms.sh">
            <a id="connect">Connecting to <code>worms.sh</code></a>
          </h2>

          <p>
            At this point, you should have an SSH key pair generated and
            confirmation from baba that your account is set up with your SSH
            public key authorized. Logging in is simple:
          </p>

          <p>
            <code class="codeblock"
              >baba@macbook ~ % ssh admin@worms.sh<br />
              Enter passphrase for key &#39;/Users/baba/.ssh/id_ed25519&#39;:<br />

            In this example, I am logging in as user <code>admin</code>; you‚Äôll
            use the username you chose, i.e.¬†<code
              >ssh &lt;your-username&gt;@worms.sh</code
            >. Once logged in, you‚Äôll be dropped into an interactive shell, just
            like the one on your Mac ‚Äì except now you‚Äôre remotely interacting
            with the <code>worms.sh</code> server!<a
              href="#fn5"
              class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref5"
              role="doc-noteref"

            >
          </p>

          <p>
            You can now run the commands you were running before, like
            <code>ls</code>. If you run <code>ls</code>, you‚Äôll see just one
            file ‚Äì a directory called <code>public_html</code>. Try running
            <code>cd public_html</code> and then <code>ls</code> again. This
            time, you‚Äôll see a file called <code>index.html</code>. This is your
            homepage which is hosted on
            <code>worms.sh/~&lt;your-username&gt;</code>! Now we‚Äôll go over how
            to edit this file.
          </p>

          <h3 id="editing-text">Editing text</h3>

          <p>
            To edit your homepage, you‚Äôll need to use a text editor. FreeBSD has
            a simple built-in editor called <code>ee</code>. Try running
            <code>ee</code> from your interactive prompt; the text in your
            terminal should clear and be replaced by the text editor interface.
            At the top will be a few lines of text like this:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="codeblock">^[ (escape) menu ^y search prompt ^k delete line   ^p prev li     ^g prev page
^o ascii code    ^x search        ^l undelete line ^n next li     ^v next page
^u end of file   ^a begin of line ^w delete word   ^b back 1 char ^z next word
^t top of text   ^e end of line   ^r restore word  ^f forward char
^c command       ^d delete char   ^j undelete char              ESC-Enter: exit
=====line 1 col 0 lines from top 1 ============================================</code></pre>

          <p>
            These are the available shortcuts in <code>ee</code>, where
            <code>^</code> is <code>Ctrl</code>. If you start typing text, you
            should see it appear under this menu. When you run <code>ee</code>,
            you‚Äôll start editing a new file. Since we want to edit
            <code>index.html</code>, let‚Äôs exit out and start over ‚Äì press
            <code>ESC-Enter</code> and then select the
            <code>b) no save</code> option with <code>Enter</code>. You‚Äôll be
            dropped back into your shell in the directory you were in.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to running programs, the command line shell can also
            pass ‚Äúarguments‚Äù to those programs. Arguments are ways of giving the
            program additional inputs such as file names, input text, or
            enabling optional features (‚Äúoptions‚Äù). Each program has different
            allowed inputs and options; thankfully, you can always read up on
            how to use a program by reading its manual with the
            <code>man</code> program. Try running <code>man ee</code>. You
            should see a document like this:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="codeblock">ee(1) ee(1)

            NAME
            ee - easy editor

            SYNOPSIS
            ee [-e] [-i] [-h] [+#] [file ...]
            ree [-e] [-i] [-h] [+#] [file ...]
            [...] </code></pre>

          <p>
            You can scroll through with your arrow keys (mouse scrolling might
            work too). You don‚Äôt really need to know the details about
            <code>ee</code>, but the synopsis gives us useful information. Here,
            we see the allowed methods of running <code>ee</code>. The square
            brackets indicate optional arguments ‚Äì since they‚Äôre all optional,
            you can run <code>ee</code> on its own, like we did just earlier!
            But we can also provide one or more files <code>[file ...]</code>.
            Let‚Äôs try it ‚Äì press <code>q</code> to quick out of the manual
            program and get back to your shell.<a
              href="#fn6"
              class="footnote-ref"
              id="fnref6"
              role="doc-noteref"
              ><sup>6</sup></a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, make sure you‚Äôre in the <code>public_html</code> directory,
            where <code>index.html</code> lives. If you‚Äôre not, use
            <code>cd</code> to navigate to <code>~/public_html</code> (<code
              >~</code
            >
            is shorthand for your home directory in file paths). Then, run
            <code>ee</code> again, but this time give <code>index.html</code> as
            an argument: <code>ee index.html</code>. You should see some HTML
            code, which you can now start editing! You can save your work by
            opening the main menu with <code>ESC</code> and navigating to the
            <code>file operations</code> submenu, where you‚Äôll see a save
            option. <code>ee</code> supports Emacs-style keybindings ‚Äì this is a
            way of saying you can string a series of key presses together to
            specify certain commands without manually navigating each menu. For
            instance, you can save by pressing <code>ESC c c</code>, one key
            press after the other.
          </p>

          <p>
            As soon as you edit <code>index.html</code> and save, you can
            refresh your browser and see the updated changes at
            <code>worms.sh/~&lt;your-username&gt;</code>!
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, to navigate back to your home directory, you can do
            <code>cd ..</code>. The <code>..</code> is a shorthand for the
            parent directory to the one you‚Äôre currently in.

            Congratulations! You now have all the tools you need to start
            editing your home page and exploring the FreeBSD operating system on
            <code>worms.sh</code>! It might seem intimidating and cumbersome at
            first, but it‚Äôll all become second nature as you grow accustomed to
            working through a terminal interface.
          </p>

            A couple final notes. 1. Please don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions!
            We‚Äôre all here to learn together. 2. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment!
            Try things, write scripts and programs, write web pages that bring
            down the whole server ‚Äì the more you break things, the more I get to
            learn as an administrator :)

            We went through a few basic UNIX shell commands, but we barely
            scratched the surface. You don‚Äôt even know how to make a new
            directory, rename a file, or delete stuff!
            <a
              href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/essential-linuxunix-commands/"
              >This article</a
            >
            gives a pretty good overview of core UNIX commands. The first two
            sections are the most important. Here‚Äôs what I would consider the
            minimal list of commands to know: <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>,
            <code>pwd</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code>,
            <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>cat</code>,
            <code>less</code>, and <code>man</code>. You can probably guess what
            most of these do (except for <code>cat</code>‚Ä¶) just by their names.
            If you know these by heart and have a text editor handy, you can do
            basically anything!
          </p>

          <p>
            A word of caution: be <strong>very</strong> careful when using
            commands like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, and
            <em>especially</em> <code>rm</code>. All of these can and will
            irrevocably delete or overwrite files without asking for
            confirmation. Always double check that these commands will do what
            you want them to do, and don‚Äôt run commands or use options you don‚Äôt
            understand! On that note, also keep in mind that this server is not
            backed up. Keep a copy of important data (like your webpage!!)
            somewhere else.

            There‚Äôs a range of terminal-based editors out there if you want to
            improve your editing workflow (my favorite is
            <code>vim</code>/<code>neovim</code>). You can also edit on your
            computer and push changes in via a number of methods, like
            <code>scp</code> or by creating a remote git repository. This
            website itself (and the entire server infrastructure, eventually) is
            kept in a git repository at
            <code>github.com/worms-sh/worms.sh</code>!
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>tmux</code> is a tool I‚Äôve been using daily for years now
            (including now, as I write this). You probably don‚Äôt need it right
            away, but if you ever find yourself spending more than a few minutes
            at a time in the shell, you‚Äôll find it handy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your shell is configurable. By default, you‚Äôll be dropped into a
            <code>zsh</code> shell when you log in. Unless you have a reason to,
            you probably shouldn‚Äôt change this. You can configure
            <code>zsh</code> by editing configuration files in your home
            directory such as <code>~/.zshrc</code>. You probably don‚Äôt have one
            now; to look at mine, try running
            <code>cat /home/baba/.zshrc</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Side note: files that start with a <code>.</code> character (like
            <code>~/.zshrc</code>) are hidden. You can see them by using the
            <code>-a</code> option in <code>ls</code>: <code>ls -a</code>. If
            you run that in your home directory, you‚Äôll probably see a few
            hidden files already. Many of these are used for configuring
            programs.

            <a href="http://handmade-web.club/pages/guide.html">This guide</a>
            from a college webdev course's pubnix server is super helpful! It
            has a more comprehensive introduction to the terminal.
            <a href="https://handmade-web.net/">The course website</a> is also
            very cool! I learned some formatting tricks from just reading the
            page source.

            W3C has an
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/default.asp"
              >HTML tutorial</a
            >
            that I‚Äôve been following. MDN [has guides as well][mdn] and seems
            like the go-to online web dev reference. They also both have
            tutorials for CSS and JavaScript, which are technologies you‚Äôll
            probably want to use. There are tools out there which can make
            editing your web page easier ‚Äì this page was written in

            and translated into html using <code>pandoc</code>, which is a great
            for simple pages like this. There are a million web frameworks out
            there and I‚Äôd be happy to help you set any of them up! Here‚Äôs some
            relevant terminology I‚Äôve found to aid your research: static site
            generator (SSG), template engine, CSS framework, JS framework.

            git is an extremely useful tool to track and distribute changes to
            your code. The git website has a good
            <a
              href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup"
              >guide to getting started</a
            >, although it‚Äôs a bit tedious to go through the whole thing.
            Section 1.6 will get you set up and Chapter 2 goes through the
            basics. You‚Äôll need to host a remote git repository somewhere;
            GitHub is the most popular and is easy to use, but alternatives are
            aplenty. Codeberg is a non-commercial alternative, if that floats
            your boat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember to read <code>man</code> pages before you run new commands!
            They‚Äôre intimidating, but they contain a wealth of information, and
            reading just the Synopsis and the Description sections will go a
            long way. Additionally, the
            <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/"
              >FreeBSD Handbook</a
            >
            is the go-to reference for anything system-related. You probably
            don‚Äôt need this (it‚Äôs more for me than for you), but if you want to
            gain a deeper appreciation of how the system works, Chapter 3 of the
            Handbook is a good place to start.

                If you‚Äôve generated an SSH key pair before, you can use your
                existing one or make a new one. If you generate a new one, make
                sure you don‚Äôt overwrite any existing keys! You can see if you
                have any existing keys by running <code>ls ~/.ssh</code>. If you
                see a file named <code>id_*.pub</code> (where <code>*</code> is
                any string of characters), then that‚Äôs an SSH key!<a
