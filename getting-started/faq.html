    <p>This is ok! When you generate a public SSH key, it’ll append a
      human-readable identity at the end of it. This is so that you and others
      can see who the key belongs to. By default, this identity is
      <code>&lt;username&gt;@&lt;host&gt;</code>. Your computer and the server
      don’t actually look at that part, so you can change it to whatever you’d
      like. The <code>ssh-keygen</code> program has a built-in way of doing
      that: if you run <code>ssh-keygen -c</code>, you can change the
      “comment” of your key.
